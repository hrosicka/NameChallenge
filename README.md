A small interactive desktop game that challenges the user to guess the gender associated with a given first name. The application is written in Python and uses a GUI based on Tkinter. It queries the free Genderize.io API to guess the likely gender for a name. ️‍♀️ ️‍♂️


## The Name's the Game
The game will present you with a name on the screen. Your mission is to guess the gender associated with that name.

## Making Your Choice
**Radio Buttons:** - Click on the "Male" or "Female" button to indicate your guess.

**Pro Tip:** Pay attention to cultural origin, common name endings, and even intuition to make an informed guess!

**Check Button (initially disabled):** - Once you've selected a gender, the "Check" button will become active. Click this button to see if you've cracked the code!
